import Article from "../../components/Article";

export const meta = {
  title: "Custom 404 on Vercel",
  description: "Add your custom 404 error page to your app deployed on Vercel",
  date: "2020-05-28T04:45:41.982Z",
  published: true,
  tags: ["vercel", "404"],
  lang: "en",
};

export default ({ children }) => <Article meta={meta}>{children}</Article>;

Just add this to your `vercel.json` file to define your custom 404 page

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "status": 404, "dest": "/404.html" }
  ]
}
```

We are using this exact file for this blog that is made with [Contentz](https://contentz.tech), a static site generator, that already generates a `/404.html` file.

Now if you try to go to any other route you get that 404 error page. E.g. [https://www.cristianbgp.com/asdf](https://www.cristianbgp.com/asdf) and it just works ðŸŽ‰
