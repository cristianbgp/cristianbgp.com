I'm building **Space**, a minimalist desktop environment that runs entirely in your browser. Think draggable windows, a notes app with markdown, an AI chat powered, and a dock with a menu bar. All of it lives at [space.cristianbgp.com](https://space.cristianbgp.com), and I'm sharing the process as I go.

## Why build in public?

Building in public means sharing progress, decisions, and setbacks instead of waiting for a "finished" product. For Space, that means:

- **Accountability**: Writing about it keeps me moving forward.
- **Feedback**: Early visitors can try it and share what works or breaks.
- **Learning**: Explaining choices forces me to think them through.
- **Connection**: Others building similar things (or just curious) can follow along.

Space is far from done. Some features are rough, some are missing, and the design will keep changing. That's the point: it's a work in progress, and the blog is part of the build.

## What Space is (so far)

Right now Space offers:

- **Draggable and resizable windows**: A simple window manager in the browser.
- **Notes app**: Markdown editor and viewer, with a focus on simplicity.
- **AI chat**: Powered by Llama 3.3 via Groq, for quick conversations without leaving the "desktop."
- **Dock and menu bar**: Familiar desktop-style navigation and app launching.

The goal is to make it feel like a small, personal desktop you can open in any tab: no install, no account required for the core experience.

## What’s next

I’ll keep shipping updates and writing short posts like this one: what I added, what I changed, and what I’m figuring out. If you’re interested in browser UIs, side projects, or building in public, you can follow along here or star the repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/cristianbgp/space).

If you try Space and have feedback (what’s confusing, what’s broken, what you’d want next), I’d love to hear it. That’s part of building in public too.
